<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This basic chicken salad is the best and a family favorite. I like to use baked thighs or breasts that have been sprinkled with basil or rosemary.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>
    <li> ½ cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li> 
    <li> 1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>almonds in a frying pan. Toast over medium-high heat, shaking frequently. Watch carefully, as they burn easily.</li>

  <li> Mix together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and pepper in a medium bowl. Toss with chicken, toasted almonds, and celery.</li>
</ol>
